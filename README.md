# Chess_game
From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess): 
Chess is a board game for two players, called White and Black, each controlling an army of chess pieces, with the objective to checkmate the opponent's king.

## Assignment
Final Ruby course project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-ruby-final-project)

1. Build a command line Chess game where two players can play against each other.
2. Make it so you can save the board at any time.
3. Write some tests.

## Try it live

If you want to try it live, the click [here](https://replit.com/@darkstyle221/chessgame) and click green button that says 'Run'.

Or if you want to play it locally then clone this repo, go to the chess_game directory and type in terminal 'ruby main.rb'

### Constraints of the game

1. No 'En passant'.
2. No pawn promotion.
3. No castling.

I think I'll try to add them later but now my version of chess doesn't have those 3. But overall it is playable.

### Thoughts

This project was the most challenging project I've done so far. It took me 2 weeks to complete this project alone. I believe that it was tough due to the extensive range of problems that I had to face (i.e how to implement moves for particular chess pieces). 
A lot of googling, researching, asking was done so I could tackle the problem and gradually I was able to find solution for chess pieces then for board.

I implemented the same method with Players that I did with previous project (Connect Four), so that part wasn't that hard.

Even though this project was the hardest project that I had to face, the main lesson I learned after completing it, is - I felt like every problem could be solved no matter how hard it is if you have enough patience and time.
